The hotel is in need of major overhaul but the rooms are adequate and clean. Really a plain-pipe-rack kind of place. There is NO parking at the hotel and you must look for on-street parking which can be a hassle because of all the embassies that have reserved spaces on the local streets. Coffee, tea, and rolls are available for breakfast. There are suites available for families - a living room with a convertible bed and a bedroom with two beds. I would only stay at this place if you are locked in to certain dates and don't want to pay the rates at the other two major hotel - the Onmi Shoreham, or the Marriott Wardman Park.  \n",

Our room faced the courtyard, had a romantic fireplace, custom furnishings, and small kitchenette, and was more than we could have hoped for at a very resonable price. You can check out movies in the cozy office/sitting room and the hosts are more than friendly and informative. You are in the \"old neighborhood\" and can easily walk to the main street for shopping and dining. We can't wait to go back. A real GEM!  \n",
      "6904959  First off, let me start by saying that this trip was in the making for 1 year and was highly anticipated. My cousin and I (female) are both parents and wives, so naturally we were looking forward to our little get-a-way. When we arrived on April 10, 2001 at the SBR&S we were a little taken aback by the surrounding property...no lush vegetation and area locals \"hanging out\" at the main gate. Check in was relatively smooth because we arrived a little after noon time and our room was ready for us. The first thing that caught me off guard was the fact that I had to leave my credit card # for an in room safe key, normally safes are included with your packages since you're paying all inclusive rates. The fee was $100, and this was in the event if I should lose the key then my card would be charged for that amount. Once we got into our room we were a little disappointed. the door to our room was not the most securest, it was half way hanging off the hinge and it had the nerve to have a chain lock on it. Second, the room was not in the best of condition, the walls appeared to be in deseparate need of a paint job and the bed spreads were dirty (they do not change the bed linens during your stay). The bathroom was not in the best shape either. low water pressure -- not a very good thing when you're next in line to use the bathroom! What most insulted me about our room was the fact that when we looked in the bathroom there was almost less that 2 quarters of toilet paper left on the roll with no other replacements left in the bathroom. we called room service for more toilet paper and towels, but we never received anything. we had to take it apon ourselves to take it from the maid cart. we kept asking about the towels we were told that we could not have additional towels because fresh towels would be placed in the room on a daily basis! now, keep in mind we're in the caribbean were it's hot daily, you're constantly sweating and bathing and you're only entilted to one towel and one I know it's all inclusive and they want everyone to take it easy on the drinks, but I kid you not those drinks were weaker than weak. The drinks that they didn't know how to make, such as rum runners and planter's punche were too strong and undrinkable. We stuck to the coffe and the Red Stripe beer. the food was ok -- everyday the same choice just served differently. the 2 resturants only serve based on reservations and you can only attend each rest. once during your stay and your choice is limited to one appetizer or soup and your entree. no you can't have more than one! My last complaint stems toward the female staff. They were very rude and very unfriendly. After speaking with other female guest at the hotel they felt the same coldest. Naturally when we spoke with the male guest they had no complaints about the female staff, just the opposite about the men. I was told by one of the locals out there (male) that Jamaican woman do not like american woman -- no matter what their color -- something about we like stealing their men! I think they've caught to many reruns of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back!\" And just about every jamaican guy's name was Winston (based on the male character in that movie). I can honestly say that the beach was nice and our room view was also nice. But to me there are a lot of things that can be improved at this hotel. I say go at own your risk. Consider a resort in Negril first.  \n",

I was sick with a cold when we arrived in Boston on our honeymoon. Our first stop was to our hotel - the Fairmont Copley - and we were early so the room (we booked a regular room) wasn't ready. We trekked in the rain over to the Art Museum to kill time until we could get our room. When we went back a few hours later, the lady at the front desk gave my husband a key to the presidential suite. You can not even imagine what we walked in to - two bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, a living room, and a master bedroom. We had five windows that faced right out on to Copley Square! It was truly amazing. The staff at the Fairmont Copley couldn't have been nicer...and we have a great honeymoon story to boot!!!!  \n",

The location is perfect for walking through the town without having to fight for parking. While the rooms in the main house are very charming, I especially like staying in the coach house which offers two places complete with their own kitchens and living rooms on the ground floor and becautiful, in the trees, bedrooms on the second floor. The proprietors are wonderful people and every time I have stayed, I have met interesting guests from all over the world.  \n",

Chinatown is that. Hotel gave us that as it is clean, perfect location and no issues. Room had microwave, fridge (big), cook top.  \n",

But the hotel is very crowded and some thing is not in a good condition. For example, the sink is leaking and it cause the flood inside the bathroom. Shuttle bus service from hotel to airport is charged.  \n",

We witnessed most probably the worst customer service skills that we to have ever seen, bearing in mind one of us works in the retail business which prides itself on giving good quality customer service at all times. For what witnessed, a member of your catering team was shouting and was being aggressive towards a couple in front of us (who didn't speak English very well) like us didn't understand the set menu and therefore we declined to eat the breakfast part of our stay which we paid for. 2. Overall the size of our room didn't matter as we were only staying here for 3 nights, but the shower design is not up to standard as water leaks through the gap where the glass don't meet as it is a sliding glass door. This creates a slip & trip hazard to anyone in the room. 3. After a rather poor night sleep due to the mattress being uncomfortable my partner was woken up by a member of the cleaning staff (before checkout which is midday) was knocking at our door and attempted to enter the room, we thought this was invading our privacy. Overall we wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. Even though the location is very good, but the experience we received has put us off from coming back.  \n",
